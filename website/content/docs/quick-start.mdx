# Quick Start

With TSDX, you can quickly bootstrap a new TypeScript project in seconds, instead of hours.

## Create a New Project

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
bunx tsdx create mylib
```

You'll be prompted to choose from one of the available templates:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `basic` | A basic TypeScript library with vitest |
| `react` | A React component library with Testing Library |

After you select one, TSDX will create a folder with the project template and install all dependencies.

## Specifying a Template

You can skip the prompt by specifying the template directly:

```bash
bunx tsdx create mylib --template basic
# or
bunx tsdx create mylib --template react
```

## Start Developing

Once your project is created, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd mylib
```

Start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Now edit `src/index.ts` (or `src/index.tsx` for React) and see your changes rebuild automatically!

## Available Commands

Inside your new project, you can run:

```bash
bun run dev       # Start development mode with watch
bun run build     # Build for production
bun run test      # Run tests with vitest
bun run lint      # Lint with oxlint
bun run format    # Format with oxfmt
bun run typecheck # Type check with TypeScript
```

## Building for Production

When you're ready to publish your package:

```bash
bun run build
```

This outputs:
- `dist/index.js` - ESM bundle
- `dist/index.cjs` - CommonJS bundle
- `dist/index.d.ts` - TypeScript declarations

## Publishing

```bash
# Build the package
bun run build

# Publish to npm
npm publish
```

We recommend using [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) or [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for a better publishing workflow.
