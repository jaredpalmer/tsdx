# TSDX

**TSDX is a zero-config CLI that helps you develop, test, and publish modern TypeScript packages** with ease—so you can focus on your awesome new library and not waste another afternoon on configuration.

<Callout type="info" title="TSDX 2.0">
  TSDX 2.0 is a complete rewrite using modern, high-performance Rust-based tooling. See the [Migration Guide](/docs/migration) if upgrading from v0.x.
</Callout>

## Features

- **Zero config** - Sensible defaults, just start coding
- **Modern tooling** - Built on [bunchee](https://github.com/huozhi/bunchee), [vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html), and [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter)
- **Dual ESM/CJS** - Automatic dual module builds with proper exports
- **TypeScript first** - Full TypeScript support with declaration generation
- **Lightning fast** - Rust-powered linting (50-100x faster than ESLint) and formatting (35x faster than Prettier)
- **Bun-native** - Uses bun for package management
- **Modern Node.js** - Supports Node.js 20+ (LTS)

## Tool Stack

TSDX 2.0 uses modern, high-performance tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Performance |

| [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) | Testing | Vite-native, Jest-compatible API |
| [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) | Linting | 50-100x faster than ESLint |
| [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter) | Formatting | 35x faster than Prettier |

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: 20+ (LTS)
- **Bun**: Latest version

## Quick Example

```bash

bun run dev
```

That's it! Start editing `src/index.ts` and build your library.
