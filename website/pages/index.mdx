# TSDX

<Features />

Despite all the recent hype, setting up a new TypeScript (x React)
library can be tough. Between Rollup, Jest, tsconfig, Yarn resolutions,
ESLint, and getting VSCode to play nicely....there is just a whole lot
of stuff to do (and things to screw up).

**TSDX is a zero-config CLI that helps you develop, test, and publish
modern TypeScript packages** with ease--so you can focus on your awesome
new library and not waste another afternoon on the configuration.

## Quick Start

With TSDX, you can quickly bootstrap a new TypeScript project in seconds, instead of hours. Open up Terminal and enter:

```bash
npx tsdx create mylib
```

You'll be prompted to choose from one of three project templates:

| Template               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `basic`                | A plain TypeScript project setup you can use for any kind of module.                                                                                                                            |
| `react`                | A React package with necessary development dependencies and `@types` installed. In addition, there is a [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)-powered React playground you can use while you develop. |
| `react-with-storybook` | Same as the basic React template, but with [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) already setup as well.                                                                                  |

After you select one, TSDX will create a folder with the project template in it and install all dependencies. Once that's done, you're ready-to-rock! TypeScript, Rollup, Jest, ESlint and all other plumbing is already setup with best practices. Just start editing `src/index.ts` (or `src/index.tsx` if you chose one of the React templates) and go!

## Useful Commands

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the project in development/watch mode. Your project will be rebuilt upon changes. TSDX has a special logger for your convenience. Error messages are pretty printed and formatted for compatibility VS Code's Problems tab.

/>

Your library will be rebuilt if you make edits.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Bundles the package to the `dist` folder.
The package is optimized and bundled with Rollup into multiple formats (CommonJS, UMD, and ES Module).

/>

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs your tests using Jest.

### `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`

Runs Eslint with Prettier on .ts and .tsx files.
If you want to customize eslint you can add an `eslint` block to your package.json, or you can run `yarn lint --write-file` and edit the generated `.eslintrc.js` file.

### `prepare` script

Bundles and packages to the `dist` folder.
Runs automatically when you run either `npm publish` or `yarn publish`. The `prepare` script will run the equivalent of `npm run build` or `yarn build`. It will also be run if your module is installed as a git dependency (ie: `"mymodule": "github:myuser/mymodule#some-branch"`) so it can be depended on without checking the transpiled code into git.

## Best Practices

TSDX includes best-practices and optimizations for modern NPM packages. These include things like the ability to have different development and production builds, multiple bundle formats, proper lodash-optimizations, treeshaking, and minification to name a few. All of these come out-of-the-box with TSDX. While you probably won't need to configure anything, [you totally can do so with tsdx.config.js](customization).

Before you start extending TSDX though, you'll want to fully understand what _exactly_ TSDX does. In the next section, we'll go over all of these optimizations in finer detail.
